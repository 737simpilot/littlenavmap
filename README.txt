Little Navmap

Little Navmap is a free flight planner, navigation tool, moving map, airport search and airport
information system for Flight Simulator X and Prepar3D.
It can be run stand alone or in networked configuration.
Connection to the flight simulator needs the free Little Navconnect program
which eases network setup across two or more computers.

See the Little Navmap help for more information.

Little Navmap supports FSX, FSX Steam Edition and Prepare3d Versions 2 and 3.

An installer or setup program is not available.

Do not extract the archive into the folder "c:\Program Files\" or "c:\Program Files (x86)\" since
you will need administrative privileges in some Windows versions. Since Windows keeps control on
these folders other problems might occur, like replaced or deleted files.
Extract the Zip archive into a folder, like "c:\Own Programs\Little Navmap".
Then start the program by double-clicking "littlenavmap.exe".

Little Navmap is a 32-bit application and was tested with Windows XP 32-bit,
