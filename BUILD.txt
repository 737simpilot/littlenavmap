# Compile the `littlenavmap` Application

This depends on the `atools` library. Make sure you installed, configured and compiled all necessary
tools as described in https://github.com/albar965/atools/blob/master/BUILD.txt.
See the needed setup for Qt Creator there.

Qt development packages of Core, Widgets, XML and SQL are needed with minimum version 5.6.
GIT command line tools are required.
The marble widget is needed (see https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/wiki/Compiling#compile-marble).

- Clone atools GIT repository (git clone https://github.com/albar965/atools.git)
- Clone littlenavmap GIT repository (git clone https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap.git) into the same
  directory as atools.

Get Marble from my repository which contains a few needed improvements:

https://github.com/albar965/marble.git

Build an install it according to the included instructions here
https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/wiki/Compiling#compile-marble .
Use branch `lnm/1.1` for the Marble build.

## Windows

- Get `Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.1u` from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html and install it.
- Configure the projects and enable shadow build for release or debug versions.
- Clone littlenavmap from GIT to e.g.: `C:\Projects\littlenavmap`. Use the same base directory as for `atools`.
- For littlenavmap use the build directory of e.g.: `C:\Projects\build-littlenavmap-release`
- Adapt the `QT_BIN`, `GIT_BIN`, `SIMCONNECT` and other variables in `littlenavmap.pro`. You should use the
  same values as for `atools`.
- Set the build kit for atools and littlenavmap to MinGW 32bit.
- Set a dependency to `atools` in `Project Settings` for littlenavmap.
- Run qmake from Qt Creator for all projects
- Build all projects from Qt Creator

Do not use the default shadow build directory names, this will break project dependencies.

## Linux / macOS

Install Qt development packages. Version at least 5.6.

Build atools according to instructions in BUILD.txt.

Create all build directories on the same level as the source directories `atools` and `littlenavmap`.

To build the release version:
- mkdir build-littlenavmap-release
- cd build-littlenavmap-release
- qmake ../littlenavmap/littlenavmap.pro CONFIG+=release
- make

To build the debug version:
- mkdir build-littlenavmap-debug
- cd build-littlenavmap-debug
- qmake ../littlenavmap/littlenavmap.pro CONFIG+=debug
- make

## Branches / Project Dependencies

Little Navmap has to be built using the mingw environment as Marble compiles only on the same.

Make sure to use the correct branches to avoid breaking dependencies.
The branch master is the unstable development branch but all software should compile there.

For releases check the release/MAJOR.MINOR branches to get the correct dependencies.
The atools branch is usually one MAJOR number ahead.

So Little Navmap branch release/1.2 should work well with atools release/2.2 for example.
