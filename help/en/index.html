      <img class="textimg" style="width: 100px; height:auto" alt="Little Navmap" title="Little Navmap" src=
      "images/navroute.svg" /> Version 0.9.5.develop.
    </p>
    <!-- ===================================================================== -->

    <h2>
      Installation
    </h2>

    <p>
      An installer or setup program is not available.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="bold">Do not extract the archive into the folder <code>c:\Program Files\</code> or <code>c:\Program
      Files (x86)\</code> since you will need administrative privileges in some Windows versions. Since Windows keeps
      control on these folders other problems might occur like replaced or deleted files.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Extract the Zip archive into a folder like <code>c:\Own Programs\Little Navmap</code>. Then start the program by
      double-clicking <code>littlenavmap.exe</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Little Navmap</em> is a 32-bit application and was tested with Windows XP 32-bit, Windows 7 64-bit and
      Windows 8.1 64-bit.
    </p>

    <h2>
      General Remarks
    </h2>

    <p>
      See <a href="features.html">here</a> for a list of features.
    </p>

    <h3>
      User Interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img style="width: 100%; height:auto" alt="Little Navmap" title="Little Navmap" src="images/all.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      The user interface of <em>Little Navmap</em> consists of multipe dock windows that are arranged around the main
      window containing the map view. The dock windows can be detached from the main window and also moved around in
      their docked position. All docks can be closed if they are not needed. You can even drop docks on each other to
      create a tabbed view (tabs will appear at the bottom of the dock stack). Toolbars are also movable if you click
      on the left handle and can be closed or undocked from the main window too.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Translation and Locale
    </h3>

    <p>
      <em>Little Navmap</em> is currently only available in English. I will happily support anybody who would like to
      translate the user interface into any other language. Despite using English in the user interface the locale
      settings of the operating system will be used. So e.g. on a Germany operating system you will see <code>,</code>
      as a decimal separator instead of the English <code>.</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="bold">To avoid confusion: The screenshots in this manual were taken using German locale. This means
      that comma is used as a decimal separator and dot as a thousands separator.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Units cannot be changed currently and are adapted to aviation needs. So feet, nautical miles, knots and others
      are used.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Elevation Data Limitations
    </h3>

    <p>
      World coverage for elevation data is not available for all countries and currently ends at 60 degree north. Also
      strange artifacts can occur which I cannot influence (like south of the Alps).
    </p>

    <h3>
      Map Legend
    </h3>

    <p>
      The map legend explaining the icons on the map and the <code>Flight Plan Profile</code> is available in the
      <code>Information</code> dock window or <a href="legend.html">right here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Naming Conventions
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Empty airport:</span> An airport that has no taxiways, no parking spots or gates, no aprons
        and is not an add-on airport.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Add-on airport:</span> Airport that was found outside the Flight Simulator default scenery
        folder when loading the database.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Navaid:</span> VOR, NDB or waypoint
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Radio navaid:</span> VOR or NDB
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Rating:</span> Airports are given a zero to five star rating depending on facilities.
        Airports that have no rating are considered boring and will be displayed using a gray symbol below all other
        airports on the map. This behavior can be switched off in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Map
        Display</code> tab.
        <ol>
          <li>Add-on
          </li>

          <li>Parking spots
          </li>

          <li>Taxiways
          </li>

          <li>Aprons
          </li>

          <li>Tower building (only if at least one of the other conditions is met).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Known Problems
    </h3>

    <p>
      Please note that due to a variety of external data like KML or BGL files that can be loaded by <em>Little
      Navmap</em> crashes or malfunctions can occur. If that is the case send me the offending file and <em>Little
      Navmap</em>'s log file and configuration which can be located in the about dialog. My e-mail address is shown in
      the about dialog of <em>Little Navmap</em> too.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Support for FSX SE and P3D is untested.
      </li>

      <li>Scenery.cfg files is not found automatically in Windows XP. Set the path manually.
      </li>

      <li>Scrolling ist jerky when using OpenStreetMap or OpenTopoMap and the spherical projection. Either use the
      Plain or Simple map themes or use the Mercator projection.
      </li>

      <li>OpenStreetMap or OpenTopoMap maps can end up fuzzy when using functionality like "center route" or "show on
      map". Zoom once in and out using the scrollwheel to fix this.
      </li>

      <li>Zoom is too fast when using a touchpad with OpenStreetMap or OpenTopoMap. Use the Plain or Simple map themes
      or use the zoom buttons or the keyboard.
      </li>

      <li>Flight plan and airways are drawn using great circle lines instead of rhumb lines. Distance and course are
      not affected by this.
      </li>

      <li>In rare cases KML files can cause crashes.
      </li>

      <li>Magnetic variance in FS is partially not set - this is an error in the flight simulator source data and
      should be fixed with a workaround when loading the database
      </li>

      <li>Elevation data coverage is limited
      </li>

      <li>Elevation data errors (south of the Alps, e.g.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <img alt="Little Navmap Menu and Toolbars" title="Little Navmap Menu and Toolbars" src=
      "images/menutoolbar.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      This chapter describes the menu structure of <em>Little Navmap</em>. You will find parts of this functionality on
      the toolbars as well which are not be described separately. Key combinations can be seen on the menu items and
      are not listed separately.
    </p>

    <h3>
      File Menu
    </h3>

    <h4>
      Flight Plans
    </h4>

    <p>
      You can load, save or create new FSX PLN files. FS9 PLN files are not supported.
    </p>

    <p>
      An opened flight plan file will be reloaded on startup (reload and centering can be switched off in the
      <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Startup</code> tab).
    </p>

    <h4>
      Google Earth KML Files
    </h4>

    <p>
      You can add one or more Google Earth KML or KMZ file to the map display. All added KML or KMZ files will be
      reloaded on startup (reload and centering can be switched off in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the
      <code>Startup</code> and <code>User Interface</code> tab).
    </p>

    <p>
      All loaded KML files can be removed from the map with the menu item <code>Clear KML from Map</code>
    </p>

    <h4>
      Work Offline
    </h4>

    <p>
      Stops loading of map data from the internet. This affects only the OpenStreetMap and OpenTopoMap online map
      themes.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Flight Plan Menu
    </h3>

    <h4>
      Undo/Redo
    </h4>

    <p>
      Allows to undo and redo all flight plan changes.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Select a Start Position for Departure
    </h4>

    <p>
      A parking/gate/ramp, runway or helipad can be selected as a start position on the departure airport. A parking
      position can also be selected in the map context menu item <a href="#fpdeparture">Set as Flight Plan
      Departure</a>. If no position is selected the longest primary runway end is selected automatically as start.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Edit Flight Plan on Map
    </h4>

    <p>
      Switches flight plan edit mode on the map on or off. See <a href="#fpedit">Flight Plan Editing</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Calculate Direct
    </h4>

    <p>
      Deletes any intermediate waypoints and connects departure and destination using a great circle route.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Calculate Radionav
    </h4>

    <p>
      Creates a flight plan that uses only VOR and NDB stations as waypoints and ensures that reception of at least one
      station is ensured along the whole flight plan. Note that VOR stations are preferred before NDB and DME stations
      are not used at all. Calculation will fail if not enough radio navaids can be found between departure and
      destination.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Calculate high Altitude
    </h4>

    <p>
      Uses Jet Airways to create a flight plan. The resulting minimum altitude is set into the flight plan altitude
      field. A simplified east/west rule is used to adjust the cruise altitude (can be switched off in the
      <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Flight Plan</code> tab).
    </p>

    <h4>
      Calculate low Altitude
    </h4>

    <p>
      Uses Victor Airways to create a flight plan. Everything else is the same as in <code>Calculate low
      Altitude</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Calculate based on given Altitude
    </h4>

    <p>
      Use the value in the altitude field of the flight plan to find a flight plan along Victor and/or Jet airways. If
      the altitude value is too low calculation will fail.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Reverse Flight Plan
    </h4>

    <p>
      Swaps departure and destination and reverses order of all intermediate waypoints.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Map Menu
    </h3>

    <h4>
      Goto Home
    </h4>

    <p>
      Goes to home area <a href="#mapsethome">Set Home</a> using the saved position and zoom factor.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Go to Center for Distance Search
    </h4>

    <p>
      Go to the center point used for distance searches.<a href="#mapsetdistcenter">Set Center for Distance Search</a>

      <em>Little Navmap</em>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      More/Default/Less Details
    </h4>

    <p>
      Increases or decreases details on the map. More details mean more content, more text information and bigger
      icons.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Projection
    </h4>

    <h5>
      Mercator
    </h5>

    <p>
      A flat projection that gives the most fluid movement when using the <code>OpenStreetMap</code> and
      <code>OpenTopoMap</code> themes.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Spherical
    </h5>

    <p>
      <img style="width: 50%; height:auto" alt="Little Navmap Spherical projection and Simple Map Theme" title=
      "Little Navmap Spherical projection and Simple Map Theme" src="images/sphericalpolitical.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Shows earth as a globe which is the most natural projection. Movement can stutter when using the
      <code>OpenStreetMap</code> and <code>OpenTopoMap</code> themes. Use the <code>Simple</code> or <code>Plain</code>
      map themes to prevent this.
    </p>

    <h4 id="maptheme">
      Theme
    </h4>

    <h5>
      OpenStreeMap
    </h5>

    <p>
      <img style="width: 50%; height:auto" alt="OpenStreeMap and Hillshading" title="OpenStreeMap and Hillshading" src=
      "images/osmhillshading.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an online raster map that includes and hillshading option. Note that hillshading does not cover the whole
      globe.
    </p>

    <h5>
      OpenTopoMap
    </h5>

    <p>
      <img style="width: 50%; height:auto" alt="OpenTopoMap" title="OpenTopoMap" src="images/otm.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      A beautiful online raster map that aims to mimic a paper topographic map as much as possible. Includes
      hillshading and elevation contour lines at lower zoom levels. Disadvantage is that airports and navaids are hard
      to recognize in the colorful map.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Simple
    </h5>

    <p>
      This is an offline political map using colored countries. The map is simple and included in <em>Little
      Navmap</em>. Has an option to display city and country names.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Plain
    </h5>

    <p>
      A very simple offline map. The map is and included in <em>Little Navmap</em>. Has an option to display city and
      country names.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Force Show Addon Airports
    </h4>

    <p>
      If this option is selected add-on airports are always shown independent of the other airport map settings.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Show Airports with hard Runways
    </h4>

    <p>
      Show airports that have at least one runway with a hard surface.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Show Airports with soft Runways
    </h4>

    <p>
      Show airports that only soft surfaced runways.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Show empty Airports
    </h4>

    <p>
      Shows empty airports. This button can be hidden depending on settings in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the
      <code>Map Display</code> tab.
    </p>

    <p>
      An empty airport is defined as one which has neither parking nor taxiways nor aprons and is no add-on. These
      airports are treated differently in <em>Little Navmap</em> since they are the most boring of all default
      airports.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Show VOR Stations, Show NDB Stations, Show Waypoints, Show ILS Feathers, Show Victor/Jet Airways, Show Flight
      Plan, Show Aircraft Trail
    </h4>

    <p>
      Simply shows or hides these facilities or navaids on the map.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Show Map Grid
    </h4>

    <p>
      Shows a latitude/longitude grid as well as the meridian and anti meridian (date line) on the map.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Show Country and City Names, Show Hillshading
    </h4>

    <p>
      Availability of these options depends on the selected map theme. See <a href="#maptheme">Theme</a>.

    <h4>
      Show Information
    </h4>

    <p>
      Shows detailed information in the information panels for the nearest airport or all navaids near the cursor.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Measure GC Distance from here
    </h4>

    <p>
      Starts a measurment line on the first click. Second click ends measuring and keeps the line. All measurement
      lines are saved and will be restored on next startup.
    </p>

    <p>
      Measurement lines use nautical miles as unit. If they are short enough feet will be added as unit so one can
      measure e.g. takeoff distance for crossing takeoffs and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      A great circle gives the shortest distance from point to point on earth but does not use a constant course. For
      that reason the measurement line will indicate the course at the start and end position.
    </p>

    <p>
      Course is indicated in degrees true. Additional information like ident or frequency will be added to the line if
      the measurement starts at a navaid or an airport.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Measure Rhumb Distance from here
    </h4>

    <p>
      A rhumb line is a line of constant course and used between the waypoints of an airway or when approaching a VOR
      or NDB station. Distance between points is longer that the great circle route.
    </p>

    <p>
      The course for a rhumb line is normally indicated in degrees true. If the measurement starts at a navaid or an
      airport that have magnetic variation course will be indicated in degrees magnetic. Additional information like
      ident and frequency will be added to the line.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Remove Distance measurement
    </h4>

    <p>
      This menu item is active if you right click on the end of a distance measurement line. Removes only the selected
      line.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Show Range Rings
    </h4>

    <p>
      Shows multiple red range rings around the clicked position. Number and distance of the range rings can be
      confgured in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Map Display</code> tab. A label indicates the distance
      of each ring.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Show Navaid range
    </h4>

    <p>
      Shows a range ring around the clicked radio navaid indicating its range. A label shows ident and frequency.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Remove Range Ring
    </h4>

    <p>
      Active if the click is at the center of a range ring. Removes the ring.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Remove all Range Rings and Distance measurements
    </h4>

    <p>
      Removes all rings and distance measurement lines from the map.
    </p>

    <h4 id="fpdeparture">
      Set as Flight Plan Departure
    </h4>

    <p>
      This is active if the click is at an airport or an airport parking position. It will either replace the flight
      plan departure or add a departure if the flight plan is empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the clicked object is an airport the default runway will be used as starting position. If a parking position
      is clicked the airport and parking position will replace the current departure and start position.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Set as Flight Plan Destination
    </h4>

    <p>
      This is active if the click is at an airport. It will either replace the flight plan destination or add the
      aiport if the flight plan is empty.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Add Position to Flight Plan
    </h4>

    <p>
      Adds the clicked object to the nearest flight plan segment. If no airport or navaid is near the clicked position
      a user position will be added to the flight plan.
    </p>

    <h4>

      Search Dock Window
    </h2>

    <h3>
      General
    </h3>

    <p>
      Two search tabs are available for airport and navaid (VOR, NDB and waypoints) search.
    </p>

    <p>
      These tabs contain multiple rows of search filters that can be switched on and off with the drop down hamburger
      menu button on the top left.
    </p>

    <p>
      Filters are defined by various controls which are mostly self explaining. Only text filters and the tri state
      checkboxes like <code>Lighted</code>, <code>Approach</code> or <code>Closed</code> need extra remarks.
    </p>

    <p>
      All filters can be used in parallel where all conditions have to be met (<code>and</code> operator). All except
      the distance search filter are applied immediately. The distance search is applied after a short delay after each
      change.
    </p>

    <p>
      A short tooltip on the blue question mark gives a quick help about searching.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Text filters
    </h4>

    <p>
      The standard is to search for entries that start with the entered text.
    </p>

    <p>
      The placholder <code>*</code> stands for any text. Once a <code>*</code> is included in the term, the standard
      search is no longer used.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the first character in a search box is a <code>-</code> that search is negated (find all entries that do not
      match).
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that all of the above does not apply to numeric fields like <code>Runway length</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Tri state checkboxes
    </h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Gray:</span> Condition is ignored.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Checked:</span> Condition must match.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Unchecked:</span> Condition must not match.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Colors and look of these checkboxes vary with theme and operation system. So above might not be precise
    </p>

    <h4>
      Distance search
    </h4>

    <p>
      <img alt="Complex Distance Search" title="Complex Distance Search" src="images/complexsearch.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      This function allows you to combine all other search options with simple spatial search.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the checkbox <code>Distance</code> is checked the results will include only airports or navaids that are
      within the given minimum and maximum range of nautical miles of the search center. This allows you to quickly
      search for an destination that is within the range of your aircraft and fulfills other criteria like having
      lighted runways and fuel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally you can select a direction (North, East, South and West) to restrict the distance search.
    </p>

    <p>
      This dock window contains text information about airports in several tabs, information for one or more navaid in
      one tab, the legend for the navigation symbols and the general map legend (depends on map theme).
    </p>

    <p>
      All information can be copied into the clipboard as formatted text
    </p>

    <p>
      A link <code>Map</code> allows to jump to the shown airport or navaid on the map.

      Simulator Aircraft Dock Window
    </h2>

    <p>
      This dock window show information similar to a flight management computer about the user aircraft if connected to
      the simulator. It contains one tab that shows general aircraft data like gross weight and another tab that
      displays flight data, route progress and ambient parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
      See <a href="#connect">Connecting to a Flight Simulator</a> for more information on this topic.

    <h2>
      Flight Plan Elevation Profile
    </h2>

    <p>
      This dock window will show the ground elevation and flight plan cruise altitude together will all flight plan
      waypoints. It is only available if a flight plan is loaded. If <em>Little Navmap</em> is connected to the
      simulator the user aircraft is shown too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since elevation processing is CPU intense it is done in background after creating or changing the flight plan.
      The elevation display will be updated accordingly whenever new data is available. Close the <code>Flight Plan
      Profile</code> window if you think this causes problems. All updates will stop then.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the world coverage for elevation data is limited here. Also strange artifacts can occur which I cannot
      influence (like south of the Alps).
    </p>

    <p>
      Be aware that the elevation display only covers the route and will not change the depiction if you get off flight
      plan with your aircraft. Also aircraft climb is not depicted (no aircraft profiles yet). The flight plan is only
      shown at cruise level.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      Additional information is shown in a label on top of the window if the mouse is hovered over the diagram. The
      corresponding position within the flight plan is highlighted on the map too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following information is shown in the top label when hovering the mouse over the diagram:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>From and to waypoint
      </li>

      <li>Distance from departure and to destination
      </li>

      <li>Ground altitude
      </li>

      <li>Flight plan cruise altitude above ground
      </li>

      <li>Safe altitude for the current leg
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For more information see the <code>Navmap Legend</code> tab in the <code>Information</code> dock window or access
      the <a href="legend.html#profile">legend right here</a>.

    <p>
      Most options are self explaining and tooltips contain more detailed explanations if applicable. Therefore a more
      detailed description is not needed.

      Note that the button <code>Restore Defaults</code> only restores the options of this dialog back to default.
      Other settings like map display or table views are not affected.

      <img alt="Load Scenery Dialog" title="Load Scenery Dialog" src="images/loadscenery.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      This dialog allows to load the scenery library from all four supported simulators. It shows some information
      about the currently selected database like number of loaded airports, database version and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can select the simulator in a drop down box which will show the base path and <code>scenery.cfg</code> in two
      text edit fields. There are populated with default values first but you can change these to any other valid
      location.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img alt="Load Scenery Progress Dialog" title="Load Scenery Progress Dialog" src=
      "images/loadsceneryprogress.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Loading a scenery library can take three to six minutes depending on your setup and amount of scenery add-ons.
      You can speed this up by excluding directories containing no airport or navigation data in the
      <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Scenery Library Database</code> tab.
    </p>

    <p>
      All airports that are not located in the default <code>scenery</code> directory are considered add-on airports
      and will be highligthed appropriately. Directories can be excluded from this behaviour in the
      <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Scenery Library Database</code> tab.

      Connecting to a Flight Simulator
    </h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Install <em>Little Navconnect</em> on the computer that is running the simulator. Start it and take note of
      the message that is printed on the logging window. You only need the colored values:

        <pre xml:space="preserve">
[2016-07-24 17:31:40] Server is running on hostname <span style=
"color: blue;">windows-pc</span> (IP address <span style="color: blue;">192.168.1.4</span>) port <span style=
"color: red;">51968</span>.

      <li>Start <em>Little Navmap</em> on the flying computer or the remote client computer. <img alt=
      "Little Navconnect" title="Little Navconnect" src="images/littlenavconnect.png" />
      </li>

      <li>Open the connection dialog by selecting <code>Main Menu</code> -&gt; <code>Tools</code> -&gt; <code>Connect
      to Simulator</code>.
      </li>

      <li>Add the value for hostname. This can be either the hostname printed by <em>Little Navconnect</em> or the IP
      address. If both programs are running on the same computer you can also use <code>localhost</code>.
      </li>

      <li>Add the value for the port. <code>51968</code> is the default value.
      </li>

      <li>Click connect. Once a flight is set up and loaded on the simulator your aircraft will show up on the map and
      the <code>Simulator Aircraft</code> dock window.
