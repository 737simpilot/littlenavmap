Known Problems for version 0.9.0.beta

* Support for FSX SE and P3D is untested.

* Scrolling ist jerky when using OpenStreetMap or OpenTopoMap and the spherical projection.
  Either use the Plain or Simple map themes or use the Mercator projection.

* OpenStreetMap or OpenTopoMap maps can end up fuzzy when using functionality like "center route"
  or "show on map". Zoom once in and out using the scrollwheel to fix this.

* Zoom is too fast when using a touchpad with OpenStreetMap or OpenTopoMap. Use the Plain or
  Simple map themes or use either the zoom buttons or the keyboard.

* Flight plan and airways are drawn using great circle lines instead of rhumb lines.
  Distance and course are not affected by this.

* In rare cases KML files can cause crashes on loading.

* Occasional crashes when the elevation data is updated in background.
